### A Haskell library to generate DDL queries by analyzing diff between Haskell and Database schema based on [beam](https://github.com/mycodedstuff/beam)


#### How can this library help?

1. Generate SQL statements for a given schema (trick is to run it against an empty/undefined schema)
2. Validate if database schema is in sync
3. Generate delta DDL statement for quick sync (dev productivity)
4. Automatic schema sync on runtime (pass the generated sql statements to database)

#### Usage
Module Database.Migration exports a function schemaDiff which takes a Connection (postgresql-simple Connection type), schema name and a CheckedDatabaseSetting which returns either DB is in sync or a list of DDL statements.

Refer to [examples](examples) for implementation

Example output:
```sql
❯ stack run
Initiating connect
Connected to postgres

Table names ==>
["Configurations","Issues"]

Schema dump ==>
create schema if not exists migration;
create type migration."enum_Issues_status" as enum ('RAISED', 'ACTIVE', 'RESOLVED');
create sequence if not exists migration."Configurations_id_seq" as bigint increment by 1 minvalue 1 maxvalue 9223372036854775807 start with 1;
create table if not exists migration."Configurations" ("id" bigint not null primary key default nextval('migration."Configurations_id_seq"'::regclass), "key" varchar not null, "value" varchar not null, "createdAt" timestamp with time zone not null, "updatedAt" timestamp with time zone not null);
create table if not exists migration."Issues" ("id" varchar not null primary key, "ticketNo" bigint not null, "message" varchar not null, "status" migration."enum_Issues_status" not null, "image" bytea, "store" json, "createdAt" timestamp with time zone not null, "updatedAt" timestamp with time zone not null);
create index concurrently if not exists "Issues_ticketNo_customIdx" on migration."Issues" ("ticketNo") where "status" = 'RAISED' AND "message" = 'dummy' OR "store" IS NULL;
create unique index concurrently if not exists "Issues_ticketNo_idx" on migration."Issues" ("ticketNo");

Schema diff ==>
Schema in sync
```

#### Additional Features
##### 1. Lenient type checks for columns

This library allows you to define which type differences are acceptable using option `typeLenient`.
This options takes a function with 2 parameters column type defined in haskell schema, data type in postgres and result true if the difference is acceptable.
> This is useful in case where you already have a database whose column types may not agree with beam and running alters may not be feasible

Sample Usage
```haskell
-- Define a function which returns true for acceptable type differences
-- Takes table name, column name, haskell type and type defined in database. This function gets called if the column already exists with different type in database
-- Below function says for particular table and column if haskell schema has Text and DB has Varchar (any length) then it's acceptable and vice versa for other cases it's not
columnTypeLenient :: Text -> Text -> ColumnType -> ColumnType -> Bool
columnTypeLenient _ _ PgText (VarChar _) = True
columnTypeLenient _ _ (VarChar _) PgText = True
columnTypeLenient _ _ _ _ = False

-- Supply this function to schemaDiff via options
schemaDiff conn dbSettings $ defaultOptions {typeLenient = Just columnTypeLenient}
```
> Refer [this](#haskell-and-postgres-type-mapping-with-db-migration) table to understand type for lenient type matching

##### 2. Table Partition Support

Option `partitionOptions` can be used to provide partition names for a particular table.
When supplied this with option the mentioned partitions will be included as separate tables and will share the schema of the parent table name supplied in key

> Note: Currently both the parent table `Issues` and it's partitions will be included in validation. This option is useful for application managed partitioning.

Sample Usage
```haskell
-- Define the partitions against a table name
-- In below sample there is an Issues table with 3 partitions by month
partitions :: HM.HashMap Text [Text]
partitions =
  HM.fromList
    [("Issues", ["Issue_M_202405", "Issue_M_202404", "Issue_M_202403"])]


-- Supply this map to schemaDiff via options
schemaDiff conn dbSettings $ defaultOptions {partitionOptions = DBM.PartitionOption True partitions}
```

##### 3. Ignore order of Enum values

Option `ignoreEnumOrder` if set to `True` allows to remove differences in enums if the order isn't same as defined in Haskell.
If this is `False` library will generate queries to rename existing enums and create new and type casting all columns using it.
By default it's set to False.

Sample Usage
```haskell
schemaDiff conn dbSettings $ defaultOptions {ignoreEnumOrder = True}
```

##### 4. Index Verification

Indexes can be verified by defining the Table instance's tableIndexes method.
This library allows you to define normal, unique and partial indexes via helper function which also helps in type safety.

The below examples defines two indexes for Table Issues both being on `ticketNo` column
```haskell
instance B.Table IssueT where
  data PrimaryKey IssueT f =
    IssuePrimaryKey (B.C f Text)
    deriving (Generic, B.Beamable)
  primaryKey = IssuePrimaryKey . _id
  tableIndexes tblName tblFields@Issue {..} =
    [
    -- create unique index concurrently if not exists "Issues_ticketNo_idx" on migration."Issues" ("ticketNo");
      uniqueIndex tblName [IC _ticketNo]
    -- create index concurrently if not exists "Issues_ticketNo_customIdx" on migration."Issues" ("ticketNo")
    -- where "status" = 'RAISED' AND "message" = 'dummy' OR "store" IS NULL;
    , defaultIndexWithPred
        (tblName <> "_ticketNo_customIdx")
        tblFields
        [IC _ticketNo] $ \Issue {..} ->
        _status
          B.==. B.val_ RAISED
          B.&&. _message
          B.==. B.val_ "dummy"
          B.||. B.isNothing_ _store
    ]
```
There are few helper functions to define indexes safely `uniqueIndex`, `defaultIndex`, `uniqueIndexWithPred`, `defaultIndexWithPred`.
The option `ignoreIndexName` can be set if you don't want to validate index names
> Note: This feature only works with the fork of [beam](https://github.com/mycodedstuff/beam)

##### 5. Send Database Difference List Options

Option `listDifference` if set to `True` allows to send the return the differences in Haskell and database as DDL queries. Beware this will cause higher memory utilization for higher number of schemas or more no of entities.
If this is `False` library will discard the list and send only `DB_NOT_IN_SYNC` or `DB_IN_SYNC` message for each schema accordingly.
By default it's set to True.

Sample Usage
```haskell
schemaDiff conn dbSettings $ defaultOptions {listDifference = False}
```

#### TODOs

1. Support for postgres partitioned tables

#### Explore

1. Report columns defined in database not in Haskell schema
2. DROP DDL statements

#### Caveats

1. If an enum isn't named differently in database then instead of renaming the enum, this library will create a new enum and alter the columns type.
2. If a sequence isn't named correctly in database then library will create a new sequence and this new sequence won't have last_val/currval of the existing sequence
3. Some features like, index validation and schema specific enums only works with forked [beam](https://github.com/mycodedstuff/beam)

#### Notes

1. Currently this library only supports PostgreSQL database
2. Currently this library only validates if Haskell schema is defined in database. Database may have more tables and columns
3. This library uses a fork of [beam](https://github.com/mycodedstuff/beam) which has some additional fixes/improvements (You can find the original repo [here](https://github.com/haskell-beam/beam))
